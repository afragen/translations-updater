A simple plugin to enable automatic updates to your GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab hosted WordPress language packs.

## Description

This plugin was designed to simply update any GitHub hosted WordPress plugin or theme's translations. Your plugin or theme **must** contain a header in the style.css header or in the plugin's header denoting the location on GitHub. The format is as follows. The URI should point to a repository that contains the translations files. It is created using the [GitHub Updater Language Pack Maker](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater-language-pack-maker). The repo **must** be a public repo.
